The biggest change we made is to how secret passages work, they seemed 
too OP inside of rooms, so we put them in walkways.
This changed how the get room/get secret passages functions will work
We made a function called get first that we set up for the test which will eventually get the first character
of the secret passage label, after that we can use the getSecretPassage function to get the 2nd character

We used similar tests to the 306 file, as we sort of had to, but we changed all of our cells to reflect what we were trying to test
I think one door happened to be in the same place, also the number of COLS and ROWS remained unchanged, but everything else used different 
indices.

We also made testing if all the rooms were created and that they all the correct name/character into one test
