The computer players have TERRIBLE movement, but will eventually make an accusation

Section B
Clue Init 2:
Our secret passages have been changed from the general clue game and will not place you directly into rooms
Therefore: the FiliInitTest306 code will fail for the getSecretPassage way function
UPDATE: we worked around it tests pass

EDIT: the computer players movement has been improved, it takes a computer player on average 3-4 to get to their target room for a suggestion
  they still aren't the smartest, they will only make an accusation once they have seen every single card, regardless of if a suggestion could or could have have been disproved
  after playing through a few times without making an accusation in order to see how long it would take for a computer to win it took around 50-60 turns for a computer player
  to see every single card except the solution set
